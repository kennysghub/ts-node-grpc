# gRPC Project with gRPC-Web Proxy and Envoy Integration

This repository demonstrates the integration of gRPC with gRPC-Web proxy and Envoy to enable communication between gRPC-based services and web clients. It combines the efficiency of gRPC with the compatibility of web browsers.

Features:
- `gRPC`: Efficient RPC framework for communication between services.
- `gRPC-Web Proxy`: Enables gRPC communication from web browsers without a native gRPC client library.
- `Envoy`: Acts as a sidecar proxy to enhance routing, load balancing, and observability of gRPC traffic.
- `protoc`: Generates gRPC service and client code from Protocol Buffers (.proto) definition files.

This project provides examples and configuration files for setting up and deploying gRPC services with gRPC Web proxy and Envoy, simplifying  service architecture and providing web applications with efficient and compatible communication.
